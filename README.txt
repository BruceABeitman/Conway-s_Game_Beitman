Conway's Game

Written in Eclipse environment (should be easily imported with metadata)
Otherwise, compile all .java files under src, 
	execute Game to run game
	execute UnitTests to run unit tests
	|----->(Please note, unit tests use files designated in TestSuiteFiles folder)
		
		
To use Conway's Game console, use the following commands:
p - print grid
s - step grid forward, and print
f <file> - load file
t <x_coordinate> <y_coordinate> - test what the coordinate will be after next step

At this time, only the file command is supported for filling the Conway Game grid.
